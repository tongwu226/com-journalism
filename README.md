Sentiment analysis of Google autosuggestion results for presidential candidates （May 2016)

Could Google autosuggestion shift voting preference? This is the question I wants to know. 


I want to explore if, during the eye-catching presidential election season, Google autosuggestion and its algorithm could present the controversy regarding candidates unbiasedly, or it has biased filter to favor some particular candidates than others in order to shift voting preference. 


Based on the original idea, I want to extend the question further: Does autosuggestion results perform similarly to or differently from the actual searching trend regarding candidates? If the affiliation with political figures exists, is it a national-wide autosuggestion bias or is it geo location-related? Does it mean that a personal political affiliation of someone who tests the massive filters of Google search engine could manipulate thousands of indecisive voters’ voting preference?
